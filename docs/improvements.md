# Improvements

Tracked issues and enhancements for the Wegmans MCP server.

## Real Issues

- [x] **Phantom zod dependency** — `zod` is imported in `index.ts` but only resolves via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` transitive dep. Add it to `package.json` directly.
- [x] **Move build deps to devDependencies** — `@types/node` and `typescript` belong in `devDependencies`, not `dependencies`.
- [ ] **Algolia credentials duplicated 3x** — `algolia.ts`, `cart.ts:63-64`, `index.ts:76-77` all define the same constants. Centralize in `algolia.ts` and import.
- [ ] **`get_product_details` duplicates `lookupProduct`** — `index.ts:74-116` reimplements the same Algolia query that `cart.ts:lookupProduct()` already does. Reuse it.
- [ ] **Dead code: `getMyItems()` in my-items.ts** — Lines 41-81 are never called. Only `queryProductsByIds` is used. Remove or mark explicitly as experimental.

## Structural Improvements

- [ ] **`get_cart` returns raw JSON** — Every other tool formats output nicely. This one just dumps `JSON.stringify`. Format it: item name, quantity, price.
- [ ] **No refresh token usage** — `auth.ts` receives `refresh_token` but never uses it. Full re-login on every token expiry. Use the refresh token for faster, less fragile re-auth.
- [ ] **Cart merge is client-side with silent failure** — `getCurrentCartLineItems` returns `[]` on fetch error (line 111), meaning a failed read + write could overwrite the real cart with just the new item. Should throw on error instead.
- [ ] **`savePurchaseHistory` writes without pretty-print** — 893KB single-line JSON. Add `null, 2` to `JSON.stringify` for debuggability.
- [ ] **Order fetching uses hard-coded batch size** — `fetchOrders()` fetches details in serial batches of 5. Could use a concurrency limiter with `Promise.all` for better throughput.

## Nice-to-haves

- [ ] **Add project-level CLAUDE.md** — Document API quirks, auth flow nuances, which tools are legacy vs active.
- [ ] **Fill in `author` field in package.json**
- [ ] **Consider retiring `refresh_my_items` tool** — `sync_purchase_history` supersedes the manual "paste Algolia payload from DevTools" flow. Adds surface area to the tool list without much benefit.
